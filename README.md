# Forensics Web: How Speech and Debaters are Connected

## Description
This web app shows the degrees of separation and the connections between every competitor (whether interpreter, public speakers, or debater) from the state of South Carolina. The whole idea was inspired by the Huffington Post article ["The Fight for Forensics"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-schroeder/the-fight-for-forensics_b_7871538.html) because hopefully by connecting alumni of this wonderful program better efforts can be coordinated for small donations that will enable speech and debate to survive and thrive in our state.
